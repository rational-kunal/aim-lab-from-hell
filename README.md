# Aim Lab From Hell

A knockoff of Aim Lab with a twist of Death. A game developed for #js13k game entry.

The initial plan was to create a game engine from scratch, some would say re-invent the wheel, and I also did some work for it in [Over Engineered Snake](https://github.com/rational-kunal/over-engineered-snake). However, due to time constraints and a lack of ideas for a (simple) platform that involves Death ðŸ‘», I decided to ditch this plan.
After much brainstorming, I made a simple spoof of [House of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8r_x5LPBc). However, due to a lack of sprites and size limitations, I decided to make a dumb-down version of HOTD, and that version looks like Aim Lab. So that's it, this is my entry "Aim Lab From Hell".

You have applied for a job in hell prison. Before you are hired, the jailor, i.e. Grim Reaper, wants to test your ability to shoot down the souls.
